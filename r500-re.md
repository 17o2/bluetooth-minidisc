## Potential power rails for BT

### GND

Main chassis ground

- AP609
- S801 (Hold switch)
- TP910

### "VG"

Listed as 7.3 in schematic diagram.
Measured as 6.6V @ AP914 against hold switch GND
Measured as 7.0V @ C608

- IC601 - `VG` (pin 36)
- IC701 - `VG` (pin 23)
- IC901 - `VG` (pin 19)
- C608 +
- C920
- D903 - (to `LG`)
- AP914

IC901 Block diagram: IC901 "generates" `VG` (19) from `LG` (18), referenced to`PGND2` (17).

`PGND2` as ideal GND point? TP910 is relatively close to IC901 where `VG` is generated...

Overall block diagram:
IC901 `VG` is output, `LG` is direct battery voltage "VB" for headphone amp (IC302), Motor/Coil drive (IC701), System controller (IC801) via L904.
D903 (MA729-TX Schottky) links `LG` (anode) to `VG` (cathode).

### "LG"

This comes directly from battery +

- IC901 pin 18
- IC701
  - `VM1` (pin 7)
  - `VMU` (pin 49)
  - `VWVW` (pin 45)

  All three seem to be high sides of H-bridge drivers:

  - `VM1` for `RO1`, `FO1`, `RO2`, `FO2` etc. (focus and tracking coil drive)
  - `VMU` and `VWVW` for `U0`, `V0`, `W0` (`M601`, spindle)

- AP951
- AP952
- AP726

## Pairing button

`End Search` is most promising because it is unnecessary. Auto End Search can be configured in settings menu.

- Buttons = resistor ladders?
- Measure `PAUSE`, `SET KEY 1`, `SET KEY 2` aka. `D1`, `D2`, `D3`

- Use RC circuit to force longer button push for pairing?
- Somehow respect state of `Hold` slider?

## Audio out

- How to control volume (especially on AirPods)?
  - Tap volume buttons and somehow send to BT chip?
  - Force volume to max / medium on BT chip and rely on MD player volume setting

- Which line to tap?
  - `IC801` - `AOUTL` (29), `AOUTR` (30) ... maybe line level suitable for BT chip?
  - `IC302` - `IN L` (22), `IN R` (21) ... same as above? --> TBD
  - `IC302` - `OUT L` (2), `OUT R` (4) ... coupled to headphone jack via C and R
- Tap appropriate `GND`!!

## BTMD v0.1

### Materials

- Sony MZ-R500 Minidisc player ([minidisc.org](https://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-R500.html), [MiniDisc wiki](https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/portable/mz-r500))
- [Scosche FlyTunes](https://www.scosche.com/wireless-bluetooth-audio-transmitter) Bluetooth transmitter
- [Pololu S7V8F3](https://www.pololu.com/product/2122) voltage regulator module
- 0.14mmÂ² wire
- Kapton tape

### Preparation of Bluetooth module

Open the casing of the Bluetooth transmitter. The approach that worked best was to clamp the casing in a vise to crack it open. The two halves separated rather cleanly.

Desolder the Li-Ion battery, the USB-C jack, the tactile switch, and the wires going to the 3.5mm audio plugs.

[v0.2](v0.2.md) also removes the two status LEDs and their resistors.

### Preparation of Minidisc unit

Remove the back cover to expose the main PCB.

Detach the ribbon cable going to the front PCB, which handles the buttons and LCD screen on the front of the device. Separate the front casing from the MD mechanism. Be careful not to lose the little torsion spring.

Remove the front PCB, cut both traces going to the `End Search` tactile switch, and expose a bit of the traces (on the side of the cut going to the switch). Solder wires to the exposed traces. The `End Search` switch will act as the power and pairing button for the Bluetooth module.

:information_source:
v0.1 uses blue wires everywhere. [v0.2](v0.2.md) improves this by using differently colored wires for each net.

See the [reverse engineering page](re.md) to read more about how this button was chosen

TODO: Image with markings where to cut the PCB traces

Remove the magnetic write head from the MD mechanism, as well as the little bracket holding it in place. This is necessary since otherwise these parts will collide with the Bluetooth module once everything is assembled.

:warning:
This obviously means that the MD unit is no longer a recorder, but only a player. A small price to pay for wireless glory!

:information_source:
For [v0.2](v0.2.md), even more guts had to be removed!

### Integration

Mount the bluetooth module and the voltage regulator module on the inside of the front plasic casing with double-sided tape. Protect the PCBs against short circuits with Kapton tape. Wire everything up as per the schematic. Secure the wiring with Kapton tape.

Close everything back up. Enjoy!

And then realize everything you could have done better, and proceed with [v0.2](v0.2.md).

# Tips and lessons learned

## Helpful tips and hints

- Unsure whether a specific BT transmitter will work -> buy multiple
- Prototyping/Reverse engineering: tap test pads, etc. and break out to breadboard-compatible connector
- Do not hook up stuff directly to each other. Use a breadboard inbetween for more flexibility / "mix&match" / "plug&play"
- Have PCB layout PDF? Print one sheet per size at same scale, cut out and paste back to back, hold against light to easily trace vias
- Take time to prepare properly to avoid errors/frustration later on
  - Proper cables to tap test points: thin solid wire -> stranded wire 0.25mmÂ² -> dupont connector
